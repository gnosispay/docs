### 1. Create a Card Order

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/create
```

This endpoint creates a new `CardOrder` with the status of `PENDINGTRANSACTION` .

The Card Order is created with the following data:

- A shipping address can be specified by filling the `shippingAddress` field, see [endpoint specifications](/api-reference/create-a-new-card-order). If not set, the KYC address will be used for shipping.
- The total amount to be paid is set in EURe. The amount is 30.23.
- A coupon code can be applied to reduce the amount to be paid, either at signup or in the next step

### 2. (Optional) Attach a Coupon

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/{orderId}/attach-coupon
```

This endpoint attaches a coupon to the `CardOrder` with `orderId`.
The coupon needs to be valid, otherwise an error is thrown.
If the user has a coupon code both from the signup, and from this step, the one from the signup takes precedence.

### 3. (Optional) Attach an on-chain transaction

<Note>
This is only needed if the card is not free.
</Note>

```jsx
PUT /api/v1/order/{orderId}/attach-transaction
```

When the card isn't free, a payment must be performed for the card order. This endpoint allows setting a transaction hash to the specified `orderId`.

The transaction can only be used once across all card orders.

### 4. Confirm the payment was performed

<Warning>
This endpoint must be called even if the card is free. It moves the card order to the `READY` status.
</Warning>

```jsx
PUT /api/v1/order/{orderId}/confirm-payment
```

In order to call this endpoint, the `CardOrder.status` needs to be `PENDINGTRANSACTION`.

If `CardOrder.totalAmountEUR` is the same as the `CardOrder.totalDiscountEUR` then the card is considered free.

#### Successful Payment Conditions

If the card is not free, we check if a payment was done. The conditions for the payment are:

- Token used for payment needs to be EURe `0xcB444e90D8198415266c6a2724b7900fb12FC56E`.
- Payment was done to `0x3D4FD6a1A7a1382ae1d62C3DD7247254a0236847`.
- The respective EURe amount was paid in that transaction hash (partial transfers are not supported).

If all the conditions above are met, the `CardOrder.status` is set to `READY`.

### 5. Create the Physical Card

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/:orderId/create-card
```

When successful, this endpoint returns the `cardToken` from the newly created card.

In order to create a `Card` out of a `CardOrder` the following conditions need to be met:

- No cards were created out of this `orderId`.
- User needs to have a verified phone number.
- User needs to have a name set.
- User needs to be from a supported country.
- User address needs to be set.
- User needs to have an approved KYC.
- The risk score needs to be Green or Orange based on the user's answers to the Source of funds questionnaire.
- User needs to have the shipping details for the physical card order set.
  - The shipping details can be different from the KYC address, as long as it is in the same country.
  - Virtual cards do not require a shipping address.
- The embossed name for the card needs to be set.

### 6. Set the Card PIN using the Partner Secure Elements (PSE)

The card PIN should be set immediately after the card is created via the Partner Secure Elements (PSE).
Use the `cardToken` returned from the previous endpoint to set the PIN.
If a PIN is not provided upon creation, a random one will be assigned. 
Changing this randomly assigned PIN requires the user to visit an ATM. Refer to the **[card PINs section](/cards#card-pins)** to learn more about the online and offline PINs.

For detailed instructions about how to change the PIN, please refer to the [PSE SDK documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnosispay/pse-sdk).

## Card Order State Transitions

Understanding the card order state machine is crucial for handling different scenarios in your application. Below is the complete state transition diagram and detailed explanations.

### State Transition Diagram

  [*] --> PENDINGTRANSACTION : Create Order

  PENDINGTRANSACTION --> READY : Pay (free or paid)
  PENDINGTRANSACTION --> TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE : Payment Complete
  PENDINGTRANSACTION --> CANCELLED : Cancel
  PENDINGTRANSACTION --> FAILEDTRANSACTION : Payment Failed

  TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE --> CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED : Request Confirmation

  CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED --> READY : Confirm Ready<br/>(SOF + Phone + Address)

  READY --> CARDCREATED : Create Card<br/>(Physical/Virtual)

### Card Order States

#### Core States

**`PENDINGTRANSACTION`** - *Initial State*
- **Description**: Order created, awaiting payment or confirmation
- **Next States**: `READY`, `TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE`, `CANCELLED`, `FAILEDTRANSACTION`
- **User Actions**: Attach transaction, confirm payment, cancel order

**`TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE`** - *Payment Processed*
- **Description**: Payment transaction completed but requires additional verification
- **Next States**: `CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED`
- **System Actions**: Automatic transition when additional verification needed

**`CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED`** - *Verification Needed*
- **Description**: Additional user verification required (SOF, phone, address)
- **Next States**: `READY`
- **Requirements**: Phone verified, SOF completed, address provided

**`READY`** - *Ready for Card Creation*
- **Description**: All requirements met, ready to create physical/virtual card
- **Next States**: `CARDCREATED`
- **User Actions**: Create card with PIN (physical) or without PIN (virtual)

#### Terminal States

**`CARDCREATED`** - *Success*
- **Description**: Card successfully created and ready for use
- **Next States**: None (terminal state)
- **Note**: Virtual cards are immediately active; physical cards need activation

**`CANCELLED`** - *Cancelled*
- **Description**: Order cancelled by user or system
- **Next States**: None (terminal state)
- **Note**: Only possible from `PENDINGTRANSACTION` state

**`FAILEDTRANSACTION`** - *Payment Failed*
- **Description**: Payment processing failed
- **Next States**: None (terminal state)
- **Note**: User needs to create a new order

### Transition Rules

#### 1. Pay Transition: `PENDINGTRANSACTION` → `READY`
Conditions:
- Free card: totalAmountEUR === totalDiscountEUR
- Paid card: Valid EURe payment to correct address
- Transaction hash validation (if required)


#### 2. Request Confirmation: `TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE` → `CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED`
Triggered when:
- Additional user verification needed
- System determines extra checks required

#### 3. Confirm Ready: `CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED` → `READY`
Requirements:
- User phone verified
- Source of Funds (SOF) completed
- Valid shipping address (for physical cards)

#### 4. Create Card: `READY` → `CARDCREATED`
  Requirements:
- KYC approved
- Risk score: Green or Orange
- For physical cards: Encrypted PIN required
- For virtual cards: No PIN needed

#### 5. Cancel: `PENDINGTRANSACTION` → `CANCELLED`
Conditions:
- Only from `PENDINGTRANSACTION` state
- User-initiated or admin-initiated


### Error Handling

When implementing card order, consider these scenarios:

**Invalid Transitions**
Will throw TransitionError
- Trying to cancel from READY state
- Attempting to create card from `PENDINGTRANSACTION`
- Any transition not defined in the state machine


**Common Error Scenarios**
- **Payment Issues**: Transaction hash already used, insufficient payment
- **User Requirements**: Missing KYC, unverified phone, missing address
- **System Issues**: Payment processor errors, card creation failures

### Implementation Example

```javascript
// Check current order state before taking action
const handleOrderAction = async (order, action) => {
  switch (order.status) {
    case 'PENDINGTRANSACTION':
      if (action === 'pay') {
        await confirmPayment(order.id);
      } else if (action === 'cancel') {
        await cancelOrder(order.id);
      }
      break;

    case 'READY':
      if (action === 'createCard') {
        await createCard(order.id, { setPin: !order.virtual });
      }
      break;

    case 'CARDCREATED':
      // Order complete - handle card activation if needed
      break;

    default:
      throw new Error(`Cannot perform ${action} on order with status ${order.status}`);
  }
};
```

### Cancellable States

Orders can only be cancelled from specific states. Use the `CANCELLABLE_ORDER_STATUSES` constant:

```javascript
const CANCELLABLE_ORDER_STATUSES = [
  'PENDINGTRANSACTION',
  'TRANSACTIONCOMPLETE',
  'CONFIRMATIONREQUIRED',
  'FAILEDTRANSACTION'
];
```

<Warning>
**State Validation**: Always validate the current order state before attempting transitions. Invalid transitions will throw a `TransitionError` and return HTTP 422 status code.
</Warning>
