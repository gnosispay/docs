title: Create Virtual Card
description: Virtual cards work either online or tap in presence (with Apple Pay and Google Pay).

Virtual card orders have a **simplified flow** compared to physical cards, with these key differences:

- No shipping address is required
- The card is available immediately after order creation (no shipping delay)
- Virtual cards can be used for online transactions immediately
- Thanks to Google and Apple Pay (some regions are not yet available), the card can be used for in-person transactions immediately.
- No PIN is required; the user's phone number is used as second factor authentication for some online payments
- **Cards are automatically created and activated when the order is placed**

## How to create a Virtual Card

This endpoint allows you to issue a virtual card directly. Virtual cards are free and activated immediately. No shipping address or payment validation required.

<Warning> 
**Automatic Card Creation**: By calling this endpoint, the virtual card is automatically created if the user's Safe account is properly configured. You do not need to call any other endpoint.
</Warning> 

```jsx
POST /api/v1/cards/virtual
  ```

The virtual card should appear immediately in the card list available with the endpoint:
```jsx
GET /api/v1/cards
```

<Note>
Card Limits: Users can have a **maximum of 10 active cards including physical and virtual cards combined**. Active cards exclude voided, lost, and stolen cards.
