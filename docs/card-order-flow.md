# Cards Orders Flow 

Our card order flow supports both free and paid cards. 
You can provide a `couponCode` if you have one, that will affect the card's price. 


## Create a new Card 

### 1. Create a Card Order

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/create
```

This endpoint creates a new `CardOrder` with the status of `PENDINGTRANSACTION` .

The Card Order is created with the following data:

- Address data is taken from the `User` and cannot be modified.
- The total amount to be paid is set in EURe. The amount is 30.23.
- The `couponCode` applied is taken from the `User.referalCouponCode` . 

### 2. (Optional) Attach a Coupon

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/{orderId}/attach-coupon
```

This endpoint attaches a coupon to the `CardOrder` with `orderId`.
The coupon needs to be valid else an error is thrown.

We recommend you send the couponCode on the order creation and avoid this step. 

### 3. (Optional) Attach an on-chain transaction

```jsx
PUT /api/v1/order/{orderId}/attach-transaction
```

For the card order, a payment must be performed. This endpoint allows setting a transaction hash to the specified `orderId`.

The transaction can only be used once across all card orders.

:::info 
Calling this endpoint is optional because the card can be free.
::: 


### 4. Confirm the payment was performed

```jsx
PUT /api/v1/order/{orderId}/confirm-payment
```

In order to call this endpoint, the `CardOrder.status` needs to be `PENDINGTRANSACTION` .

This endpoint validates if the card order is free. If `CardOrder.totalAmountEUR` is the same as the `CardOrder.totalDiscountEUR` then the card is considered free. 

#### Successful Payment Conditions

If the card is not free, we check if a payment was done. The conditions for the payment are:

- Token used for payment needs to be EURe `0xcB444e90D8198415266c6a2724b7900fb12FC56E`.
- Payment was done to `0x3D4FD6a1A7a1382ae1d62C3DD7247254a0236847`.
- The respective EURe amount was paid in that transaction hash (partial transfers are not supported).

If the conditions above are met, the `CardOrder.status` is to `READY` .

:::caution 
Even if the card is free, this endpoint needs to be called to move the card order to a `READY` status.
::: 

### 5. Create a Card

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/:orderId/card
```

In order to create a `Card` out of a `CardOrder` the following conditions need to be met:

- No cards were created out of this `orderId`.
- The risk score needs to be Green or Orange.
- User needs to have a verified phone number.
- User needs to have a name set.
- User needs to be from a supported country.
- User address needs to be set.
- User needs to have an approved KYC.
- User needs to have the shipping details for the physical card order set.
    - The shipping details can be different from the KYC address, as long as it is in the same country.
    - Virtual cards do not require a shipping address.
- The embossed name for the card needs to be set.

:::caution
In order to create a card, users need to set a pin code. 
This pin should be sent encrypted, using Paymentology's public key.
::: 

## Virtual Card Orders

In addition to physical cards, we support virtual card orders. 
Virtual card orders have a **simplified flow** compared to physical cards, with these key differences:

- No shipping address is required
- The card is available immediately after order creation (no shipping delay)
- Virtual cards can be used for online transactions immediately
- No PIN required
- **Cards are automatically created when the order is placed**

### 1. Create a Virtual Card Order

```jsx
POST /api/v1/order/create
```

When creating a virtual card order, you need to specify the `cardType` as `VIRTUAL` in the request body:

```json
{
  "cardType": "VIRTUAL"
}
```

:::warning Important: Automatic Card Creation
When you create a virtual card order, **the virtual card is automatically created** if the user's Safe account is properly configured. You do NOT need to call the card creation endpoint separately.
:::

### 2. ~~Create a Virtual Card~~ Card Auto-Creation

**For virtual cards, skip this step!** The card is automatically created during order creation.

```jsx
‚ùå DO NOT CALL: POST /api/v1/order/:orderId/card
```

If you call this endpoint for a virtual card order, you will receive an error: `"Card was already created for the specified order"` because the card was auto-created in step 1.

### 3. Verify Card Creation

After creating a virtual card order, you can verify the card was created by listing the user's cards:

```jsx
GET /api/v1/cards
```

The virtual card should appear in the card list immediately after order creation.

:::info
Virtual cards are ideal for users who want immediate access to their card for online transactions without waiting for physical delivery. Once Google and Apple Pay are available in the region, the card can be used for in-person transactions too.
:::

:::caution Physical vs Virtual Card Flows
- **Physical Cards**: Follow the complete 5-step flow including explicit card creation
- **Virtual Cards**: Only need step 1 (order creation) - card auto-creation handles the rest
