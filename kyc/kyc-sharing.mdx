    <Step title="Get Partner's Sumsub Client ID">
        Contact the GP Partner team to obtain their SumSub Client ID, which is required for sharing Gnosis Pay KYC data of users.
    </Step>

<Step title="Share KYC Data">
    <p>
      Once you have obtained the Sumsub Client ID, you can generate a reusable token using the Gnosis Pay API.
    </p>

      ```bash cURL
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/kyc/import-partner-applicant \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
        "forClientId": "CoolCoinLtd",
        "ttlInSecs": 600
      }'
      ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get applicant data from Sumsub">
    <p>
    You can pass this token to sumsub's API and import the applicant data. To learn more about how to use sumsub's API, visit their documentation [here](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/copy-applicant).
    </p>

      ```bash cURL
      curl -X POST \
         'https://api.sumsub.com/resources/applicants/-/import?shareToken=_act-0b8a43f6-b70f-4ad3-bda9-7ce904589380'
      ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The partners should already agree to use sumsub and have a valid agreement between Sumsub and Gnosis Pay.
