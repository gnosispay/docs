## KYC Sharing Partners

The following partners are currently available for KYC data sharing:

| Partner | Sumsub Client ID |
|---------|------------------|
| Noah | `noah.com_112876` |
| BRLA | `brla.digital_101963` |

<Steps titleSize="h3">
    <Step title="Get Partner's Sumsub Client ID">
        For existing partners available for KYC sharing, use one of the Client IDs from the table above. For partners not listed in the table, contact the Partner team to obtain their SumSub Client ID.
    </Step>

<Step title="Share KYC Data">
    <p>
      Once the Sumsub Client ID has been obtained, generate a reusable token using the Gnosis Pay API.
    </p>

      ```bash cURL
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/kyc/import-partner-applicant \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
        "forClientId": "noah.com_112876",
        "ttlInSecs": 600
      }'
      ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get applicant data from Sumsub">
    <p>
    Share this token to Sumsub's API to import the applicant data. To learn more about how to use Sumsub's API, visit their documentation [here](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/copy-applicant).
    </p>

      ```bash cURL
      curl -X POST \
         'https://api.sumsub.com/resources/applicants/-/import?shareToken=_act-0b8a43f6-b70f-4ad3-bda9-7ce904589380'
      ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The partners should already agree to use sumsub and have a valid agreement with Sumsub and Gnosis Pay.
