Webhooks provide real-time notifications when events happen in the Gnosis Pay system.

Rather than constantly polling our APIs for updates, you can configure webhook endpoints to receive instant notifications about user activities, KYC status changes, card transactions, and more.

## Why We Send Complete Entities

<Info>
Our [Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) authentication system](/auth) requires customers to generate short-lived tokens (JWTs) that expire after 1 hour. This means your application may not always have a valid token to fetch updated data from our APIs.
</Info>

To minimize additional API calls, we send complete entity data whenever possible in our webhook payloads. For example, when a user updates their profile, we'll send the complete user entity rather than just the changed fields. This ensures your application has all the necessary data to process the event, even without an active authentication token.

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Configure Your Endpoint">
    Set up a webhook endpoint in your application that can receive HTTP POST
    requests. This endpoint must be publicly accessible and return a 2xx
    status code to acknowledge receipt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register with Gnosis Pay">
    Contact the Gnosis Pay team to configure your webhook URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Events">
    When events happen in the Gnosis Pay system, we'll send HTTP POST requests to
    your webhook endpoint with event data and cryptographic signatures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and Process">
    Verify the webhook signature to ensure authenticity, then process the event
    data in your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Security

All webhooks include cryptographic signatures using **Ed25519 asymmetric cryptography**:

- **`X-Webhook-Timestamp`**: Unix timestamp when the webhook was sent
- **`X-Webhook-Signature`**: Base64-encoded Ed25519 signature

<Warning>
  **Always verify webhook signatures** before processing events. This ensures
  the webhook originated from Gnosis Pay and hasn't been tampered with.
</Warning>

Retrieve the public key for signature verification from our API:

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://webhooks.gnosispay.com/api/v1/public-key
```

## Event Delivery and Reliability

<Info>
  **Retry Policy**: If your webhook endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, we'll retry delivery up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes).
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Timeout**: Your webhook endpoint must respond within 30 seconds. Requests that exceed this timeout are considered failed and will trigger our retry mechanism.
</Warning>
