Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in the Gnosis Pay system.

Instead of polling our APIs for updates, you can configure webhook endpoints to receive instant notifications about user activities, KYC status changes, card transactions, and more!

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that send event data to your application when specific actions occur in the Gnosis Pay system. This enables you to:

- **React immediately** to user actions and system events
- **Reduce API calls** by eliminating the need for polling
- **Build responsive applications** that stay synchronized with Gnosis Pay
- **Automate workflows** based on real-time events

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Configure Your Endpoint">
    Set up a webhook endpoint in your application that can receive HTTP POST
    requests. This endpoint should be publicly accessible and return a 2xx
    status code to acknowledge receipt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register with Gnosis Pay">
    Contact the Gnosis Pay team to configure your webhook URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Events">
    When events occur in the Gnosis Pay system, we'll send HTTP POST requests to
    your webhook endpoint with event data and cryptographic signatures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and Process">
    Verify the webhook signature to ensure authenticity, then process the event
    data in your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Security

All webhooks include cryptographic signatures using **Ed25519 asymmetric cryptography** for security:

- **`X-Webhook-Timestamp`**: Unix timestamp when the webhook was sent
- **`X-Webhook-Signature`**: Base64-encoded Ed25519 signature

<Warning>
  **Always verify webhook signatures** before processing events. This ensures
  the webhook originated from Gnosis Pay and hasn't been tampered with.
</Warning>

You can retrieve the public key for signature verification from our API:

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://webhooks.gnosispay.com/api/v1/public-key
```
