title: Sign Messages with GP Safe
description: Learn how to sign messages using your GP Safe account with the delay module for enhanced security.
---

Unlike traditional EOA (Externally Owned Account) message signing, GP Safe message signing goes through the delay module.

<Note>
Message signing with GP Safe requires the account to be fully configured with the delay module enabled. If you haven't set up your Safe account yet, see the [Safe Account Configuration](/onboarding-flow#4-safe-account-configuration) section first.
</Note>

## Message Signing Process

GP Safe message signing follows the same two-phase pattern as other delayed operations:

1. **Enqueue Phase**: Submit the message signing request to the delay queue
2. **Dispatch Phase**: Execute the message signing after the delay period expires

[You can find a complete working example here.](https://github.com/gnosispay/account-kit/blob/main/examples/src/sign-safe-message/index.ts)

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Prepare the Message">
First, prepare the message you want to sign. 

This can be any string, such as: 

```typescript
const message = "Hello, this is a message to be signed by my GP Safe!";
```

Or structured data that needs to be signed by your GP Safe account. 

</Step>

<Step title="Enqueue the Message Signing Request">
Use the `populateSignMessageEnqueue` function to create a transaction that submits your message signing request to the delay queue.

```typescript
import { populateSignMessageEnqueue } from "@gnosispay/account-kit";

const owner: Signer = {}; // Your wallet signer
const account = "0x..."; // Your GP Safe address
const chainId = 100; // Gnosis Chain

const enqueueTx = await populateSignMessageEnqueue(
  { account, chainId },
  message,
  // EIP-712 signature callback
  ({ domain, primaryType, types, message }) =>
    owner.signTypedData(domain, primaryType, types, message)
);

// Send the enqueueTx using your wallet
```

<Warning>
This transaction will be queued in the delay module and cannot be executed immediately. The delay period (typically 3 minutes) must pass before the message can be signed.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for the Delay Period">
The message signing request is now in the delay queue. You must wait for the configured cooldown period to expire before proceeding.

<Info>
The default delay period is 3 minutes (180 seconds). This provides time for you to review and potentially cancel the operation if needed.
</Info>

You can check the delay queue status using the `accountQuery` function from `@gnosispay/account-kit`.

</Step>

<Step title="Dispatch the Message Signing">
Once the delay period has expired, use the `populateSignMessageDispatch` function to execute the queued message signing operation.

```typescript
import { populateSignMessageDispatch } from "@gnosispay/account-kit";

const dispatchTx = populateSignMessageDispatch(
  { account },
  message
);

// Send the dispatchTx using your wallet
```

<Note>
Unlike the enqueue transaction, the dispatch transaction doesn't require a signature since it's executing a previously authorized operation.
