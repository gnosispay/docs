description: "How to send funds from the Gnosis Pay Safe to your EOA or somewhere else."

The withdrawal feature allows partners to withdraw tokens from Gnosis Pay Safe accounts to any external address **on the Gnosis Chain**. 
All transactions are gasless, enabling users to perform these operations completely free of charge.

The withdrawal process involves the following steps:

1. **Fetch Transaction Data** - Get the EIP-712 typed data for signing
2. **Sign and Submit** - Sign the transaction and submit the withdrawal
3. **Monitor Execution** - Wait for the delay relay to process the withdrawal

<Warning>
Please remember the following:
- The signing wallet must be one of the Gnosis Pay Safe signers (EOA or smart contract wallet)
- For smart contract wallets, signatures are verified using ERC-1271 standard
- Withdrawals are processed after a 3-minute delay as transactions are going through the Gnosis Pay delay relay
- Cards are temporarily frozen for 3 minutes during withdrawal processing as a security measure
</Warning>

## Withdrawal Process 

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Fetch Transaction Data for Signing">

Get the EIP-712 typed data that needs to be signed by the user's wallet [(spec)](/api-reference/account-management/get-typed-data-for-withdrawing-from-the-users-safe-account):

```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
/api/v1/accounts/withdraw/transaction-data?tokenAddress=${tokenAddress}&to=${toAddress}&amount=${amount}
```

The response contains EIP-712 typed data that needs to be signed by the user's wallet.

</Step>
<Step title="Sign the EIP-712 Typed Data">
The EIP-712 typed data from Step 1 must be signed by the user's wallet using the EIP-712 signature standard.

<Note>
**Wallet Requirements:**
- The wallet must be a signer of the Gnosis Pay Safe account
- For **EOA wallets**: Standard EIP-712 signature is used
- For **smart contract wallets**: ERC-1271 signature verification is used, and you must include the `smartWalletAddress` field in the request body
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Submit Transaction">

Once signed, [submit the transaction to execute the withdrawal](/api-reference/account-management/withdraw-from-the-users-safe-account):

```bash cURL
# For EOA wallets
curl -X POST \
/api/v1/accounts/withdraw \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "tokenAddress": "0x123456....",
  "to": "0x78910...",
  "amount": "1000000000000000000",
  "signature": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "message": {
    "salt": "0x1234567890...abcdef",
    "data": "0x123456...00de0b6b3a7640000"
  }
}'

# For smart contract wallets (include smartWalletAddress)
curl -X POST \
/api/v1/accounts/withdraw \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "tokenAddress": "0x123456....",
  "to": "0x78910...",
  "amount": "1000000000000000000",
  "signature": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "message": {
    "salt": "0x1234567890...abcdef",
    "data": "0x123456...00de0b6b3a7640000"
  },
  "smartWalletAddress": "0x..."
}'
```

</Step>
<Step title="Monitor the Execution">

The withdrawal is processed through a **delay relay mechanism** that executes after 3 minutes.

You can monitor the transaction status using the [delay-relay monitoring endpoints](/api-reference/account-management/retrieve-the-list-of-delayed-transactions-for-the-authenticated-user) or by checking your Safe's transaction history.
</Step>
</Steps>




## Complete Implementation Example

The following example demonstrates the complete flow:

```typescript
const tokenAddress = "0x..."; // Token contract address
const toAddress = "0x..."; // Destination address
const amount = "1000000000000000000"; // Amount in token base units

/**
 * Step 1: Fetch transaction data for signing
 */
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/accounts/withdraw/transaction-data?tokenAddress=${tokenAddress}&to=${toAddress}&amount=${amount}`
);
const { data: typedData } = await response.json();

/**
 * Step 2: Sign and submit the transaction
 */
const signature = await walletClient.signTypedData({
  ...typedData,
  domain: {
    ...typedData.domain,
    verifyingContract: typedData.domain.verifyingContract as `0x${string}`,
  },
});

const submitResponse = await fetch("https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/accounts/withdraw", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    tokenAddress,
    to: toAddress,
    amount,
    signature,
    message: typedData.message,
    // Include smartWalletAddress if using a smart contract wallet
    // smartWalletAddress: "0x...",
  }),
});

const { data: transactionResult } = await submitResponse.json();

/**
 * Step 3: Monitor execution (optional)
 */
console.log(`Withdrawal submitted with ID: ${transactionResult.id}`);
console.log(`Status: ${transactionResult.status}`);
console.log("Transaction will be processed after the 3-minute delay period");
```


## Security Considerations

- Make sure the user is aware this transfer is on the Gnosis Chain
- Remember that transactions cannot be reversed once executed
- Cards are temporarily frozen during the withdrawal process as a security measure

## Token Support

This feature supports withdrawing any ERC-20 token that exists in the Safe account. Make sure to:

- Use the correct token contract address
- Specify the amount in the token's base units (considering decimals)
- Ensure sufficient token balance in the Safe account
