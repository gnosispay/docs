description: General guidelines on how to integrate with GnosisPay.

Gnosis Pay offers an HTTP JSON API, fully documented using [OpenAPIâ€”you can find our specification here](https://api.gnosispay.com/api-docs/spec.json). This API reference is auto-generated from our OpenAPI spec, and you can also use the JSON file to generate client code in various programming languages.

Most API endpoints require authentication with a [JWT obtained via Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)](/auth). For your convenience, we provide a [helper app](/api-reference/auth-app) within these docs to help you generate a token and sign Safe transactions.

To make API requests using the API Reference playground, simply paste your token into the Authorization Header field.
