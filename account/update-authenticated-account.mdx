You can add more than one wallet to your Gnosis Pay user. Adding a new authenticated wallet allows you to sign in with that wallet using SIWE and start new sessions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a JWT token for session">
      Follow the [authentication flow](https://docs.gnosispay.com/auth) and get a JWT token for your Gnosis Pay user.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new wallet address">
  Make a POST call to [this endpoint](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/account-management/create-a-new-eoa-account-for-the-current-user) along with the address that you want to add.
    ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/eoa-accounts \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "address": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
    }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify if the wallet is added">
      Check [if the address is added to the user](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/account-management/retrieve-the-eoa-accounts-for-the-current-user) and should appear in the response
        ```bash
      curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/eoa-accounts \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
        ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
- Adding an **authenticated wallet** only links it to your Gnosis Pay user for sign-in.
- An authenticated wallet is **not automatically a Safe owner**.
- Only Safe owners (EOAs or smart wallets added to the Safe) can interact with the Delay Module or perform on-chain actions.
- Authenticated wallets can use the API (e.g. card orders, fetching user info), but they **cannot control funds** unless also added as Safe owners.
</Warning>
