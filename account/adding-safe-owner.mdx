description: "Add a new owner to a Gnosis Pay Safe Account"
---

Adding a new owner to a Gnosis Pay Safe registers that account as a **Delay Module owner**.  
Only Delay Module owners can approve and execute on-chain transactions.

<Warning>
**Important distinction:**  
- **Authenticated wallets** are linked to a Gnosis Pay user for API access (via SIWE and JWT).  
- **Safe owners (Delay Module owners)** are accounts explicitly added on-chain to the Safe.  
Authenticated wallets do **not** become Safe owners unless they are also as owners for the safe.
</Warning>

This guide walks through the process of adding an additional Safe owner. Once complete, the new owner will be able to approve and execute transactions through the Delay Module.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a JWT token for the session">
    Follow the [authentication flow](https://docs.gnosispay.com/auth) to obtain a JWT token for the Gnosis Pay user.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get typed data for adding a new Safe owner">
    Call [this endpoint](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/safe-owners/get-typed-data-for-adding-a-new-safe-owner) to receive the typed data.  
    Sign the typed data with the current Safe owner’s key to produce a signature.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/owners/add/transaction-data \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit the signature">
    Send the new owner’s address, the signature, and the signed message to [this endpoint](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/safe-owners/add-a-new-owner-to-the-safe).

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/owners \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "newOwner": "0x3270bf32AB647e90eF94A026c70Aa1daaaDA2382",
        "signature": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
        "message": {
          "salt": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
          "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000003270bf32ab647e90ef94a026c70aa1daaaada2382"
        }
      }'
    ```
    The operation is processed through the Delay Relay and executes after a 3-minute delay.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify ownership">
    Confirm that the new owner was added to the Delay Module by checking the [Safe’s owner list](https://docs.gnosispay.com/api-reference/safe-owners/get-the-list-of-safe-owners).

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.gnosispay.com/api/v1/owners \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
    ```
  </Step>
