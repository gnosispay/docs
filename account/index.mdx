description: "How the Gnosis Pay Safe works"
---

When a user signs up for Gnosis Pay, a new **Gnosis Pay Safe** a smart contract wallet is created on-chain.  
This Safe holds the user’s funds and is controlled only by its **owners**.  

A Gnosis Pay Safe owner can be either:  
- an **EOA (Externally Owned Account)**, or  
- another **smart wallet** (e.g. a Safe) whose owners may use passkeys, EOAs, or other signers.  

Funds in a Gnosis Pay Safe are never held by Gnosis Pay or any third party; ownership and control remain entirely with the Safe owners.

## Authenticating sessions with wallets

To access the Gnosis Pay dashboard or APIs, a wallet must authenticate using [Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE)](https://docs.login.xyz/).  
After SIWE, a JWT token is issued and used to authorize API calls (e.g. ordering cards, fetching user info, or linking additional authenticated wallets).  

Authenticated wallets are used **only for login and API sessions**. They do not perform on-chain actions and may or may not overlap with the Safe owners.

<Tip>
The first wallet connected during setup is automatically registered as both an **authenticated wallet** and the **initial Safe owner** (via the Delay Module).
</Tip>

Follow the guide on [adding an authenticated wallet](account/update-authenticated-account) for step-by-step instructions.

## Safe Smart Account

Each Gnosis Pay user is assigned a **Safe Smart Account**, a self-custodied smart contract wallet deployed on Gnosis Chain (L1).  
Currently, a new Safe is deployed for every user. Support for connecting an existing Safe multisig is planned.

### What is a smart contract wallet?

Smart contract wallets are contracts that manage assets on-chain with programmable rules.  
They enable advanced security and automation beyond EOAs.  

[Safe](https://safe.global/) is the leading smart contract wallet, securing over $70B in assets.

### Exploring the Safe setup

Users can view their Safe configuration in the [Safe web app](https://app.safe.global/) via the Zodiac app:

1. Open the Gnosis Pay Dashboard.  
2. Click **“View all transactions here”** to open the Safe web app.  
3. In the sidebar, select **Applications**.  
4. Search for **Zodiac**.  

The **Roles Module** and **Delay Module** are open-source contracts licensed under LGPL 3.0.

## Modules

Modules extend Safe functionality with custom logic.  
In Gnosis Pay, modules enforce spending rules and transaction flows while keeping user funds in self-custody.  

These modules follow the [Zodiac standard](https://gnosisguild.org/zodiac/) developed by Gnosis Guild.

---

## Roles Module

The Roles Module enforces which actions Gnosis Pay can perform on behalf of the user. It defines:

1. **Token used** → which token Gnosis Pay can spend.  
2. **Daily limit** → maximum amount spendable per day.  
3. **Recipient address** → destination for allowed transfers (e.g. the issuer’s settlement Safe).  
4. **Role delegation** → assigns these permissions to Gnosis Pay.  

Only Safe owners can update these rules.  
For example, a user may adjust the daily spending limit at any time.

---

## Delay Module

The Delay Module enforces a **3-minute delay** for all non-card transactions (e.g. transfers, deposits).  
This ensures funds remain available for card payments and prevents race conditions.

<Warning>
During the 3-minute delay, the card is paused if any non-card transactions are pending.
</Warning>

The Delay Module also ensures the user’s EOA retains ultimate control.  
During activation, the EOA becomes an indirect Safe owner via the Delay Module.  

⚠️ Reconfiguring or removing the Delay Module may prevent Gnosis Pay from functioning properly.

## What happens if I lose access to my EOA Wallet?

If you’ve forgotten the password to your EOA Wallet, you can regain access using its seed phrase.

<Warning>
However, if you’ve lost access to the seed phrase and cannot regain access to the EOA, you will also lose access to the Safe if it’s the only owner.
</Warning>

**To mitigate this risk, consider using a [Safe](https://safe.global/) with multiple owners instead of an EOA.**
