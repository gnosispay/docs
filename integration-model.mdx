## Integration Models: Permissionless vs Partnerships

Gnosis Pay offers two ways to get started:

1. Permissionless Integration
2. Partnership Integration

---
## 1. Permissionless Integration (Free Plan Only)

Developers can start building with our APIs right away—no need to contact us or go through an approval process. This lets you quickly enable crypto payments, card issuance, and account features for your users.

<Info>
This integration requires no special credentials. Simply authenticate with our APIs using SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) to receive a JWT token and start building.
</Info>

**Who it's for:** Developers or small teams who want to explore the APIs, prototype, or run very lightweight programs.

  <Card title="What You Can Do" icon="check" color="#16a34a">
    - ✅ Make API calls immediately — no API keys, approvals, or contracts
    - ✅ Issue and manage Gnosis-branded cards for testing and early users
    - ✅ Experiment with basic functionality (card issuance, transactions, balance queries)
  </Card>

  <Card title="What You Can't Do" icon="x" color="#dc2626">
    - ❌ Attribute card activity back to your business (no webhooks, no tracking)
    - ❌ Display sensitive card details (requires Partner Secure Element)
    - ❌ Launch a branded card program at scale
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="🚀 When to Move On" icon="arrow-right" color="#2563eb">
Once you want to connect card activity to your app/business or expose sensitive card details, you'll need to switch into Partnership mode.
</Card>

## 2. Partnership Integration (Free, Startup, and Enterprise)

## **Getting Your PartnerID and APP_ID**

Once your partnership application is approved, our team will provide you with:
- **PartnerID**: A unique identifier for your partner organization within the Gnosis Pay ecosystem, enabling us to track user acquisition and attribute activity to your integration.

- **APP_ID**: An application-specific identifier that allows partners to authenticate with the PSE (Partner Secure Elements) and establish secure mTLS connection authentication between partner and Gnosis Pay.

<Info>

    1. Submit your partnership application through the [provided link](https://form.typeform.com/to/naN3irHW?typeform-source=gnosispay.com).
