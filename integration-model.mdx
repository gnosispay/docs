## Integration Models: Permissionless vs Partnerships


Gnosis Pay offers two ways to get started:

1. Permissionless Integration
2. Partnership Integration

<h3>**1. Permissionless Integration:**</h3>
<p>Developers can start building with our APIs right away—no need to contact us or go through an approval process. This lets you quickly enable crypto payments, card issuance, and account features for your users.</p>

<Info>
    This integration requires no special credentials. Simply authenticate with our APIs using SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) to receive a JWT token and start building.

<h3>**2. Partnership Integration:**</h3>
<p>If your company is interested in deeper collaboration—such as branded cards, custom user experiences, fee rebates, or co-marketing opportunities — [you can apply to become a Gnosis Pay partner](https://form.typeform.com/to/naN3irHW?typeform-source=gnosispay.com). As a partner, you'll unlock additional benefits and support tailored to your business needs.</p>

As shown in the diagram above, partnership integration requires two key credentials: a PartnerID and an APP_ID.

#### **Getting Your PartnerID and APP_ID**

Once your partnership application is approved, our team will provide you with:
- **PartnerID**: A unique identifier for your partner organization within the Gnosis Pay ecosystem, enabling us to track user acquisition and attribute activity to your integration.

- **APP_ID**: An application-specific identifier that allows partners to authenticate with the PSE (Partner Secure Elements) and establish secure mTLS connection authentication between partner and Gnosis Pay.

<Info>
    To get your PartnerID and APP_ID, please follow these steps:
    1. Submit your partnership application through the [provided link](https://form.typeform.com/to/naN3irHW?typeform-source=gnosispay.com).
    2. Wait for approval from Gnosis Pay team.
    3. Once approved, you will receive an invite to join slack where we will communicate your PartnerID and APP_ID and provide technical support.
