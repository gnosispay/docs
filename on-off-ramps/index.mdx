# On/Off Ramp Integrations

Convert between fiat currencies and stablecoins seamlessly with Gnosis Pay's integrated ramp partners.

<Warning>
**No Double KYC Required**

On/Off ramp integrations don't require users to complete another KYC process with Gnosis Pay - they can use their existing verification from our integrated partners.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Important Partnership Requirements**

Please be aware of the following integration requirements:

- **Direct Provider Relationships**: Wallet/platform must establish a direct relationship with the ramp provider (e.g., Noah, Monerium, Avenia)
- **3-Party Agreements with Ramp Providers**: Integration requires agreements between platform, the ramp provider, and SumSub
- **Provider-Specific Requirements**:
  - **Noah**: Requires clientID agreement + Sumsub integration
  - **Avenia**: Requires clientID agreement + Sumsub integration
  - **Monerium**: KYC is supported through [Gnosis Pay API endpoint](on-off-ramps/iban-integration)
- **Mandatory Sumsub KYC**: It is mandatory to use Partner Sumsub instance to avail these integrations.


For detailed KYC sharing implementation, please refer to our [KYC Sharing Integration Guide](on-off-ramps/kyc-sharing).
