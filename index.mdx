Here is what you can do with the card:

1. **Instant spending**: Easily spend crypto like you spend cash.
2. **Global Acceptance**: At 80+ million Visa merchants worldwide.
3. **Self-custody**: Take control of your money through your SAFE account.
4. **Best FX**: Leverage the power of DeFi to get the best FX rate for your business or leisure trips.
5. **Best Cashback**: Up to 5% cashback on eligible transactions based on the amount of GNO you hold.

Your account also grants you access to **SEPA Bank Transfers**. 
An IBAN (International Bank Account Number) can be linked to your SAFE Wallet,
allowing you to make bank transfers just like you’re used to with your fiat currency.
